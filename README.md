# MathQuill Fork

As current Mathquill development progress appears to be slow, this fork merges several features.

* Matrix mode from [Learnosity](https://github.com/Learnosity/mathquill/tree/matrix)

  * Adds `\matrix`, `\pmatrix`, `\bmatrix`, `\Bmatrix`, `\vMatrix`, and `\VMatrix`
  * `ctrl-space` to add a column, `ctrl-enter` to add a row

Alternative formula editor that looks promising is [guppy-js](), but not sure it supports as many features as MathQuill currently.

The MathQuill project is supported by its [partners](http://mathquill.com/partners.html). We hold ourselves to a compassionate [Code of Conduct](http://docs.mathquill.com/en/latest/Code_of_Conduct/).

MathQuill is resuming active development and we're committed to getting things running smoothly. Find a dusty corner? [Let us know in Slack.](http://slackin.mathquill.com) (Prefer IRC? We're `#mathquill` on Freenode.)

## Getting Started

MathQuill has a simple interface. This brief example creates a MathQuill element and renders, then reads a given input:
```javascript
var htmlElement = document.getElementById('some_id');
var config = {
  handlers: { edit: function(){ ... } },
  restrictMismatchedBrackets: true
};
var mathField = MQ.MathField(htmlElement, config);

mathField.latex('2^{\\frac{3}{2}}'); // Renders the given LaTeX in the MathQuill field
mathField.latex(); // => '2^{\\frac{3}{2}}'
```

Check out our [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.mathquill.com/en/latest/Getting_Started/) for setup instructions and basic MathQuill usage.
