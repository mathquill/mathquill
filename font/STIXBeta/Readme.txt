README.TXT for STIX Fonts OpenType Format Beta Release
================================

RELEASE DATE:  31 October 2007

Please note that this beta test is confined to the OpenType version of the STIX Fonts.  A separate beta test of the TeX package for the STIX Fonts (using standard Type1 fonts) will be scheduled as soon as the LaTeX support is ready in about 60 - 90 days.

3.  Known Problems

The STIX Fonts project staff is already aware of a small number of problems with these fonts.  The problem list can be viewed at http://www.stixfonts.org/betamessages.html.  These problems should not affect your ability to use the fonts for the beta test and all will be corrected before the final release version is shipped.

We encourage you to return frequently to the STIX Fonts Web site to view updates to documentation under the "STIX Beta Test" tab.

5.  Providing Feedback

You are encouraged to provide us with feedback regarding problems discovered, additional glyphs that you feel should be added to the font set, etc.  There are two mechanisms for providing feedback:

a.  Send an email message to betatest@stixfonts.org.  Please use this method if you need to attach example files.
b.  Post a message using the Feedback Page under the STIX Beta Test tab on the STIX Fonts Home Page, www.stixfonts.org.

PLEASE sent us your comments.  We are especially eager to hear about problems using the fonts with software applications that are important to you.

6.  Planned Duration of the Beta Test

We expect the beta test to continue through 15 December 2007, but we may shorten the test by a week or two if it appears that we have received sufficient feedback.
