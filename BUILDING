To build mathquill, you will need a node.js installation.
We recommend https://github.com/visionmedia/n for installing node,
otherwise, you can get it from http://nodejs.org/ .

You will then need to update the dependencies with `npm`, like so:

    % npm install

If this installs properly, you should simply be able to run `make`,
and mathquill will be built in the `build/` directory.  Alternatively,
for development, you can run `make server`, which will automatically
re-make, and also serve the demo, the unit tests, and the visual tests.

            demo -> http://localhost:9292/test/demo.html
      unit tests -> http://localhost:9292/test/unit.html
    visual tests -> http://localhost:9292/test/visual.html

If any of this does not work, please let us know!  We want to make
hacking on mathquill as easy as possible.
